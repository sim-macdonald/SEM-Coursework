# Code of Conduct

1. Respect and Teamwork
   Mutual Respect: Respect every member on the basis that each one's contribution, thoughts, and opinions are valued. Inappropriate behavior, bigotry, and personal attacks will not be tolerated.
Encouraging atmosphere: Make an atmosphere in which every member feels wanted and appreciated by helping a behind-schedule colleague.
Collaboration: For a good working procedure, every member must be ready to cooperate with the rest in participation at all stages of the project and be ready to contribute equally.

2. Communication
Open and Clear Communication: All conversations related to discussion topics should take place on pre-agreed platforms like GitHub, Slack, or any other viable application, unless stated otherwise. Members should respond within 24 hours, unless stated otherwise.
Regular Updates: Such people must always go for regular updates in the form of stand-up meetings, using GitHub Issues or Kanban boards for project management. 
Constructive Feedback: The feedback must always be constructive towards improving the quality of work and appreciating each other's effort. 

3. Attendance and Meeting Participation
Stand-up Meetings: Everyone is expected to attend the stand-up meetings. Absence for any meeting should be communicated in advance to the team; otherwise, your personal contribution will be rated based on that. Code Reviews: You are expected to attend all code review sessions. If you turn up unprepared or late, there is a fine from the coursework brief.
Punctuality: The student will arrive on time for all meetings and code reviews. Meeting time starts with or without the student and showing up late/poor preparation risks limiting the review score of the team to 40%.

4. Individual Responsibilities and Contributions
Principle of Equal Contribution: The contribution must be fair and balanced; there is a division of labor based on the strengths that each of its members brings to the team, and at each point of evaluation, it must ensure that its members make important contributions.
Task Management: All the tasks are to be managed using Kanban boards. The work to be allocated to each member should be done by the specified time. The responsibilities and tasks must be divided in such a way that contributions become individualistic, fair, and responsible. 
Individual Contributions: Individual contributions are tracked using GitHub analytics. Members are expected to commit often, and they are also expected to review and follow up on issues regularly.
Contribution Spreadsheet: A spreadsheet is kept that records each member's percentage contribution at each of the five evaluation points. This should be published to Moodle with the master branch.

5. Quality and Best Practices
Standards: All codes given in the project should be of an agreed standard, commented on, and of high quality. Any code given should go under review by team members before being accepted into the main branch.
Branching: The working group shall work on different branches according to the standards set by GitFlow, such as master, develop, and release. Without proper testing and peer review, no work should be committed to the master.
Documentation: This means that each group member will document his or her code well enough to make sense to others reading it easily. 
6. Conflict Resolution
Internal disagreement: Any disagreement arising within the group should be resolved straightaway using a rational and respectful approach. If not settled internally, this will be forwarded to the module delivery team for the next meeting.
Team-member Termination: Any member found in violation of the code of conduct or failing to contribute their fair part will be subjected to the following procedure for termination:
Proof of the violation will be presented to the module delivery team.
The student will be provided with a confidential opportunity to discuss any extenuating circumstances with the team or module team. A module team would then decide upon the removal. 

7. Responsibilities and Deadlines
 Deadlines: All project team members will have to meet the deadlines of a project. Time frames for code reviews, documentation, and testing are provided. 
Submission Deadlines. Individual Members submit tasks well in advance of the final submission date to leave some buffer time for evaluation and integration.
Peer review: Within all levels of review, the team members are to review contributions from their peers. Based on this peer review, individual scores can be scaled, and the contributions can be tracked with GitHub and the assessment spreadsheet. 

8. Code Reviews and Graded Deliverables
Code Review Preparation: The group should go into each code review having made sure that all tools are properly configured and that the program builds. If they have not done this, it will limit the grade on that review to a maximum of 40%.
Participation: Everyone is expected to participate in the code reviews; it is allowable to be excused for acceptable reasons. It is not acceptable to fail to show up and will result in a grade of 0% on that review.
Work Done: Each review needs to include a specific percentage of the project completion as estimated by the team. That is 25%, 50% and 75%. Each code review will enlist the following features:
Code Review 1 (Week 5): Setting up GitHub, Docker, etc
Code Review 2 (Week 8): Task Management and User Stories
Code Review 3 (Week 10): Completion of Integration Testing and at least halfway of Project task.
Code Review 4 (Week 13): deployment, Bug Report.

9. Continuous Integration and Testing
CI/CD: The continuous integration shall be kept by GitHub Actions. All tests should be passed before the code can be merged.
Testing of Units and Integrations: The team shall write and maintain a comprehensive set of unit and integration tests to guarantee that at any moment during development, the project works just like it is supposed to.

10. Final Submission
GitHub Repository Submission: The final version of the project should go into the GitHub repository with the main branch, along with the contribution spreadsheet.
Excel Spreadsheets: The contribution % spreadsheet listing each member's contribution shall be provided at each of the five evaluation points. 


By signing the above code of conduct, the team member ensures that he is contributing to the project's smooth development besides sharing equal duties and rewards. Breaches will be handled by implementing the remedial steps outlined.
