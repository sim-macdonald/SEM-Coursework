# User Stories:

- Country Report - Simon MacDonald

As a data analyst for a tech company, I would like to be able to use a database to query the populations of countries so that I can easily see where I have the most potential clientele. This will let us gauge how our business is doing within those countries based on the percentage of the population using our product and will allow us to grasp better where to allocate our resources and further increase the number of users using our services.

- Language Report - Simon MacDonald

As a data analyst for a tech company, I would like to use a database to query the number of people who speak the most popular languages in the world, from the most speakers to the least, including the percentage of the world population. This will allow us to tailor our product to be accessible to the most substantial number of users, overall increasing the number of users. 

- Population Report - Danussvar Jayanthi Narendran

As a data analyst for a tech company, I would like to be able to use a database to query the population of people at various geographic levels, including those living in cities and those outside cities, so that I can gain insights into the distribution of urban and rural populations across continents, regions, and countries. This will help us better understand where our user base is concentrated, identify areas with high urban populations for targeted campaigns, and enable more strategic allocation of resources to areas with significant potential for user growth.

- Capital cities Report - Aswin Vazhakkoottathil Podimon

As a data analyst for a tech company, I want to use a database to query the populations of capital cities worldwide, so that I can identify key urban areas with significant user potential. By understanding the population sizes of these capitals, we can assess our product's market popularity in major cities and strategically target our marketing efforts and resources to boost user engagement in these densely populated regions. This analysis will enable us to make data-driven decisions to enhance our outreach and optimise service delivery in capital cities that show high growth potential.

- City Report - Dylan McQuaker

As a data analyst for a tech company, I would like to be able to access the database and query a list of cities ordered by population from largest to smallest at multiple geographical levels to provide detailed demographics. This will help us understand our user demographic better which in turn will allow us to tailor our development and decisions to align with the targetted demographics that we decide upon.
