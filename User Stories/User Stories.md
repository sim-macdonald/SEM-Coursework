- Country Report - Simon MacDonald

As a global operations analyst for a tech company, I would like to be able to use a database to query the populations of countries so that I can easily see where I have the most potential clientele. This will let us gauge how our business is doing within those countries based on the percentage of the population using our product and will allow us to grasp better where to allocate our resources and further increase the number of users using our services.

- Language Report - Simon MacDonald

As a global operations analyst for a tech company, I would like to use a database to query the number of people who speak the most popular languages in the world, from the most speakers to the least, including the percentage of the world population. This will allow us to tailor our product to be accessible to the most substantial number of users, overall increasing the number of users.
